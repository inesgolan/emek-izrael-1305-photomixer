## Our project
Our project is in image proccesing. 
The main idea is object recognition:
we let you import an image and it will find the object and save it with a transparent background,
and after that, you can paste the image on a background image.
Our project also include the next features:
1. changing the object image size
2. users data base (sqlite)
3. send edited image to your mail
4. AES encryption and decryption for edited your images

## Motivation
We wanted to create an object detection algorithm that works without machine learning.

## Installation
To be able to use are project, you need to download python 3.6 and opencv 4.5.3
You can use the following links:
-[python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17028576/using-python-3-3-in-c-python33-d-lib-not-found)
-[opencv](https://opencv.org/releases/)

## How to use?
1. run client exe as admin
2. sign up / log in / enter as guest
3. choose images that:
    1. the object and/or background are not in black in white colors
    2. the object and background are not in similar colors
    3. the object covers most of the image
